ABSTRACT: This is a currency conversion program which will convert the amount set by the user in USD. User will select 
the intended currency as an output unit. The program will provide the outputs for a given set of decrement and will
continue until the condition meets. 

Equatoin used in the program:
converted amount = input amount(USD) * conversion multiplying factor

Hand calculation:
E.g.For USD to Indonesian Rupia,
 converted currency (Rupia) = 14342.35 * 100(USD)= 1434235.00
